When are we going to cherish and value black alive lives? 

In Brazil, one black person is murdered every six hours. In order to overcome this statics, some institutions in Brazil try to protect and preserve black lives, heritage and ancestry. However they do not get the importance they deserve. This filter attempts to spread their message in an artistic way. 

Taking into account covid-19 pandemic, prohibition of museums and art's therapeutic role, our main goal was to create an augmented reality art exhibition to showcase brazilian black excellence to the world. Dreaming even further, this AR aims to inspire and enrich not only communities through the human necessity of experiencing art but also empower individuals to act for change.

While coming up with the AR filter we have created art pieces for the exhibition where each one spreads an black brazilian institution that tackles different and specific aspects of racism.
